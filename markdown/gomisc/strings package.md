# the *"strings"* package

The standard library package *"strings"* contains a few dozen functions for operating on strings. We'll introduce a few of these functions:


Count

Contains
ContainsAny


Index
IndexAny


ToUpper
ToLower


Trim
TrimLeft
TrimRight

TrimPrefix
TrimSuffix

Split
SplitAfter

Repeat

Replace


Join

LastIndex



## Exercise: use and implement these string functions


write join function
write split function
write trim function


## Converting between numbers and strings
bonus: parsing ints/floats and converting ints/floats to strings

    split a number into individual digits, e.g. given int 546, how do I get []int{5, 4, 6}
    convert a single-digit int into its text equivalent character
