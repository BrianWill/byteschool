This programming course is designed for beginning- and intermediate-level students. It focuses first on the Go programming language but also covers C and Javascript.

 - [what we do NOT cover](/content/topics not covered.html)

The course is split into two tracks: [lessons](/content/lessons.html) and [practicals](/content/practicals.html). If you have a lot of patience, read through the lessons first. Otherwise, skip ahead to the practicals. Each practical tells you which lessons it expects you to have read.
