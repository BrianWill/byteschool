# Java for Go programmers


## exceptions



## compilation

code is compiled into bytecode, which is then executed by the jvm





## generics






## maps and lists

Java has not built-in equivalent of Go's slices and maps. However, the standard library includes generic classes that serve the same purpose.


## threads

Java has no goroutines or channels. However, the standard library class java.lang.Thread allows us to spawn OS threads.

locks, synchronize (deprectated?)

## abstract classes



## enhanced for loop

## inner classes

It's possible to create a class inside another class.

Java does not have proper closures like Go.
