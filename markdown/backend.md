# Java backend course

Below is a breakdown of the major topics we'll cover (in their approximate order), followed by the core text material for the course.

The first week contains some of the trickiest (and driest) topics, so it may help to read that material before the first day of class. Email me if you have questions, but we'll go through all of this material in class, so don't worry if you don't absorb it all.

Please let me know which parts of the material are hard to read or understand. A few sections are still incomplete, and I've yet to include the exercises and projects we'll do throughout the first nine weeks. I'll add those here as the course proceeds.

For the most part, the core topics will be covered in the first 6 weeks, and most of the last 6 weeks will be spent working on projects. The first four weeks will be relatively lecture heavy, but I'll avoid spending more than ~3.5 hours lecturing on any one day, and I'll split up longer lecture sessions with exercises and breaks.

Most exercises and projects will be done in groups of 2 to 3 people. The larger projects will focus on using Java, but some will involve Javascript as well. We start with Javascript before Java because Javascript is an easier language to learn first.

Weeks 1 and 2:

 - ***data as bits*** (representing numbers and text as bits)
 - ***hardware and assembly code*** (a basic overview)
 - ***Pigeon*** (a reductively simple programming language I've created for educational purposes)
 - ***operating systems*** (using the command-line shell; understanding processes and the filesystem)
 - ***the Javascript language*** (our first real programming language)
 - ***algorithms and data structures*** (searching and sorting, stacks, queues, linked lists, hashmaps, etc.)
 - ***the web*** (creating web pages with HTML, CSS, and the DOM)

Weeks 3 and 4:

 - ***version control with Git***
 - ***the Java language***
 - ***networking protocols***
 - ***databases***

Weeks 5 and 6:

 - ***Spark framework***
 - ***dependency injection***
 - ***testing***
 - ***Postgres database***
 - ***Maven*** (build tool and dependency management)
 - ***Spring framework***

Weeks 7, 8, 9:

 - ***Agile methodology***
 - ***MongoDB***
 - ***microservices***
 - ***continuous integration, continuous deployment***
 - ***Spring Boot, Spring Cloud***
 - ***functional programming*** (in Javascript, using immutable.js)
